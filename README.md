# python_adsb_demodulator

Work in progress. The idea to have a similar behaviour as dump1090 but in Python.

Doing this mainly to practice DSP but the idea is to be able to port it to micropython at some point (to ahve a raspberry pico portable device).


Now it has:
* A basic string symbol decoder
* A very basic 1 signal per file demodulator
